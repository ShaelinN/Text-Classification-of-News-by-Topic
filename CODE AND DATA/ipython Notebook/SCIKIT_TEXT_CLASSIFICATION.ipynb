        "    The Governor of the Bank of England has backed the government's decision to end its furlough scheme in October. \n",
        "    Andrew Bailey told the BBC it was important that policymakers helped workers \"move forward\" and not keep them in unproductive jobs. \n",
        "    He said coronavirus would inevitably mean that some jobs became redundant. \n",
        "    The Bank also predicted the economic slump caused by Covid-19 will be less severe than expected, but warned the recovery will also take longer. \n",
        "    More than nine million jobs have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, but the Bank expects most people to go back to work as the economy recovers. \n",
        "    Trade unions have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the scheme, which pays a share of workers' wages, to avoid mass job losses. \n",
        "    However, Mr Bailey said it was right to focus on helping people to find new jobs. \n",
        "    \"It's been a very successful scheme, but he's right to say we have to look forward now,\" he said.\n",
        "    \"I don't think we should be locking the economy down in a state that it pre-existed in.\n",
        "    The Bank said a faster easing of lockdown measures and a \"more rapid\" pick-up in consumer spending had helped the economy rebound faster than it had assumed in May.\n",
        "    Its latest Monetary Policy Report showed spending on clothing and household goods were back to pre-Covid levels.\n",
        "    However, the Bank warned of a \"material\" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%.\n",
        "    Mr Bailey said recent data suggested the recovery in consumer spending was gaining traction, while spending on food and energy bills remained above pre-Covid levels.\n",
        "    He said: \"We have had a strong recovery in the last few months. The pace puts the economy ahead of where we thought it would be in May.\"\n",
        "    However, Mr Bailey cautioned against reading too much into recent figures: \"We don't think the recent past is necessarily a good guide to the immediate future,\" he said.\n",
        "    The Bank said spending on leisure and entertainment, which accounts for a fifth of all consumer spending, remained subdued.\n",
        "    Business investment was also weak, which would weigh on the recovery.\n",
        "    Slower recovery\n",
        "    The Bank expects the UK economy to shrink by 9.5% this year.\n",
        "    While this would be the biggest annual decline in 100 years, it is not as steep as its initial estimate of a 14% contraction.\n",
        "    The Bank said the UK still faced its sharpest recession on record, with the outlook for growth now \"unusually uncertain\".\n",
        "    Mr Bailey said it was the \"largest quantum of uncertainty in a forecast\" that policymakers had ever published.\n",
        "    The Bank expects the UK economy to grow by 9% in 2021, and 3.5% in 2022, with the economy forecast to get back to its pre-Covid size at the end of 2021.\n",
        "    This compares with growth estimates of 15% and 3% respectively, in a scenario the Bank set out in May.\n",
        "    Unemployment is expected to almost double from the current rate of 3.9% to 7.5% by the end of the year as government-funded support schemes come to an end.\n",
        "    Average earnings are also expected to shrink for the first time since the financial crisis.\n",
        "    The Bank said more workers faced a pay cut or freeze in 2020, adding: \"In many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year.\"\n",
        "    Its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that there is no second wave of the virus and that there is a smooth transition to a new EU free trade agreement at the start of 2021.\n",
        "    Meanwhile, a fall in energy prices and the temporary VAT cut for hotels, theme parks and other hospitality businesses means the cost of living is expected to barely rise this year.\n",
        "    The Bank expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall close to zero by the end of 2020, before gradually rising back to its target of 2%.\n",
        "    Negative rates 'under review'\n",
        "    The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would not even think about raising interest rates until there was \"clear evidence\" the recovery had taken hold.\n",
        "    Mr Bailey also signalled that policymakers were against using negative interest rates any time soon, adding that such a move may have unintended consequences.\n",
        "    It could stop the UK's already fragile banks from lending, or lead to customers withdrawing their money and holding it in cash.\n",
        "    Policymakers also noted that High Street banks would find it difficult to cut savings rates below zero.\n",
        "    \"They are part of our toolbox,\" said Mr Bailey. \"But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them.\"\n",
        "    He said the public may find the policy difficult to understand. \"There would be a lot of explaining to do on what this means, why we're doing it, and what the benefits would be.\"\n",
        "    Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to increase its money printing programme by a further £100bn later this year.\n",
        "    She also expects the Bank to keep interest rates at 0.1% \"or below\" for \"at least five years\".\n",
        "    Are banks passing rate cuts on?\n",
        "    Millions of households that already had a variable-rate mortgage have benefitted from recent interest rate cuts.\n",
        "    However, the Bank said borrowing had become more expensive over the past six months for first-time buyers and others moving up the property ladder, particularly for people with small deposits.\n",
        "    Banks also continued to reduce rates on savings accounts. The average instant-access savings account now pays 0.1% annual interest, compared with 0.4% in February.\n",
        "    Lenders said they were restricting credit due to the uncertain economic outlook.\n",
        "    One in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment holiday because of the pandemic.\n",
        "    Stuart Paver, the managing director of Pavers Shoes says the pandemic is the \"worst shock\" the company's suffered since it was founded by his mother in 1971.\n",
        "    The company which has always been profitable, has now lost £7m over the past five months.\n",
        "    \"We went from having 170 stores to no stores, and 1500, 1600 people on furlough\", he says.\n",
        "    \"It's about survival and how you come through and how you have a business that can continue to employ as many people as possible, so it was really batten down the hatches ..and really just sort of work hard to make sure we were secure\".\n",
        "    The company is now gradually reducing the number of furloughed workers and turnover in the stores is picking up, but Stuart Paver says it's still down 40% from last year. Normally in a recession, he'd expect to lose between 5 and 8% of his turnover.\n",
        "    Mr Paver thinks recovery for businesses like his depends on consumer confidence.\n",

        "    Why can't I use an iPhone?\n",

        "    Players have to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, the most expensive option for Xbox subscribers at £10.99 a month ($14.99 in the US).\n",
        "    For that, they get access to an ever-changing library of more than 100 games, including Xbox's latest first-party titles, that can be downloaded to a games console or PC - or streamed to a phone or tablet.\n",

        "    Asset sales and a hot stock market have helped fuel a rebound for the beleaguered Japanese conglomerate, which runs the world’s largest tech fund.\n",
        "    Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive,  in 2018. Mr. Son has said he has a 300-year vision for the company, which includes investing in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.\n",
        "    TOKYO — Just four months ago, Masayoshi Son, the daring billionaire who leads the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, looked as if he might lose it all.\n",
        "    His company had just announced one of the largest annual losses of any firm in the history of corporate Japan. And tens of billions of dollars in investments he had made in high-tech industries like ride-sharing and hospitality looked set for even more devastating losses as the coronavirus pandemic limited the movement of much of humanity.\n",
        "    But on Tuesday, SoftBank declared a seemingly miraculous turnabout: It announced that it had already swung back into the black, posting a $12 billion net profit for the three-month period that ended in June.\n",
        "    A potpourri of factors pushed SoftBank back into profitability, including aggressive asset sales, successful initial public offerings by firms in which it has invested, and stock prices for its publicly traded companies that have seemingly been divorced from the reality of a cratering global economy. Some of those companies are trading at higher levels than they were before the pandemic.\n",
        "    The whiplash change in fortune, more rocket launch than roller coaster, highlights the volatility of financial markets in the era of the coronavirus. It also shows how a company like SoftBank, which has used its $100 billion Vision Fund to become the world’s largest investor in tech companies, can find its strategies disrupted or catapulted by short-term market trends.\n",
        "    Speaking on a video chat with investors and reporters on Tuesday, a somber Mr. Son said that his company had retrenched and was preparing for a long and difficult battle with Covid-19, which he said would make it difficult to predict SoftBank’s future performance.\n",
        "    Reaching back to 16th-century Japanese history, Mr. Son said that much as the Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga had used guns positioned behind shields to win a decisive victory in a battle to unify Japan, SoftBank was stockpiling cash to use for strategic investments as part of its fight against the pandemic.\n",
        "    With the virus still spreading, he said, “every day is like a war, and we entrepreneurs also are fighting against various challenges.”\n",
        "    “I believe that cash is actually the defense for us,” he said. He did not mention that Oda’s story did not end well: He subsequently died in an ambush.\n",
        "    Like Oda, Mr. Son sees himself as a transformational figure. He has frequently said he has a 300-year vision for his company, which he has tried to position as the leading investor in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. His strategy has focused on making huge investments in companies, such as Uber, that he believes have the potential to transform and dominate entire industries.\n",
        "    But a series of missteps last year, including the spectacular collapse of the office-space firm WeWork, followed by the calamitous economic impact from the pandemic, forced Mr. Son to take a detour.\n",
        "    Whereas last summer Mr. Son found himself on the offensive, announcing the launch of a second, even larger, iteration of his Vision Fund, he now finds himself playing defense, saying that he has stopped seeking outside partners for the project as he builds up his cash reserves and considers a more cautious investment strategy.\n",
        "    In March, Mr. Son committed to selling off $42 billion worth of SoftBank’s assets to pay down the company’s gigantic debt and bankroll an aggressive campaign of share buybacks aimed at shoring up his company’s flagging share prices.\n",
        "    To achieve that goal, he has tapped his most valuable assets, selling down his holdings in his most successful investment, the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as in T-Mobile and SoftBank’s mobile phone service provider in Japan.\n",
        "    So far, the tactic seems to be paying off. SoftBank’s share price has doubled from its low in March, reaching its highest levels in 20 years. The rise has been driven in part by similar comeback stories for SoftBank’s investments.\n",
        "    After a pandemic-induced market crash in the spring, investors have piled back into tech stocks, driving a rally in some of SoftBank’s flagship investments, including the workplace communications tool Slack, the medical technology company Guardant Health, and even Uber, which has managed to offset losses in its ride-sharing services with increased food delivery.\n",
        "    Perhaps most important, Alibaba has continued to deliver for Mr. Son, as the pandemic has sent its shares to record highs.\n",
        "    SoftBank has also benefited from a hotter-than-expected market for I.P.O.s after disappointing performances by two of its biggest investments last year — Uber and WeWork — temporarily cooled market sentiment toward debuts by tech companies.\n",
        "    But appetite for the offerings has come roaring back. Last month, SoftBank scored hits with the listings of the insurance start-up Lemonade as well as Relay Therapeutics, which develops cancer drugs. That raised investors’ hopes about the I.P.O. prospects for other companies in SoftBank’s portfolio, and Mr. Son said on Tuesday that five or six were making preparations to do so.\n",
        "    As of June, the Vision Fund had returned to overall profitability, the company said in its announcement. But SoftBank’s sudden turnaround did not come without an asterisk.\n",
        "    The company used Tuesday’s announcement to introduce a change in the way it reports its results, saying it would no longer announce operating profit, as was its custom, because the measure was “not useful.”\n",
        "    Asked if the decision had made SoftBank less transparent and more difficult to value — a concern expressed by analysts who have questioned whether the company’s accounting of its interests in privately held companies is too optimistic — Mr. Son said that reporting operating income did not make sense for a firm that made its money by investing in other companies.\n",
        "    Mr. Son affirmed his belief that, in assessing his company, investors should look at “shareholder value” — a metric he defines as the value of the company’s holdings minus its net debt. By that measure, he said, the company’s value had increased by $31 billion since the end of the previous quarter, in March.\n",
        "    “This is the only and most important indicator to us,” he said.\n",
        "    As the second wave of the pandemic hits, he said, there is no “guarantee the performance of the Vision Fund will remain positive.” Nevertheless, the company has already used its own money to make 10 investments in Vision Fund II, Mr. Son said, adding that more investments were “in the pipeline.”\n",
        "    “It may not be a big amount of money, but we would like to add very good companies to our portfolio,” he said, hinting that a Vision Fund III was already in the works.\n",
        "    “Some investors and the media are fed up with the idea of investing in unicorns,” Mr. Son said, referring to privately held companies with a valuation of at least $1 billion. But he said he saw the pandemic as an investment opportunity that might accelerate the transition to the kinds of A.I.-fueled companies he hopes to build his future investment portfolios around.\n",
        "    While the company may be on the defensive at the moment, its basic policy has not changed, he said. It is still “unicorn hunting.”\n",

Meanwhile, all the candidates are being forced to extend their campaigns for an additional week.\n",

        "    The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, was not overstating the case when he described it as “an amazing performance”. For Verstappen to have finally been in the fight meant everything, as the driver confirmed through a beaming grin. “It is a great result to win here,” he said. “I am incredibly happy. We have not had an opportunity to push them so far this season.”\n",
        "    There was perhaps an object lesson echoing through history at Silverstone on Sunday. The race, coming after last week’s British Grand Prix, was designated to mark 70 years since Silverstone hosted the first round of the world championship.\n",
        "    The race programme that year had advice for newcomers to the sport. “Grand prix drivers do not have to undergo strict physical training,” it read. “Moderation in eating, drinking and smoking is sufficient, for motor racing is a test of brain rather than brawn.”\n",
        "    The latter instruction proved prescient. This season Mercedes have muscled their way to the front and proved quickest on three different circuits, their car enjoying great pace allied to great downforce. Last weekend they were untouchable here until tyre failures caused late drama.\n",
        "    They had looked similarly strong this weekend but on race day, with softer tyre compounds in use this time, the very strength of the car appeared to plague it. It was so quick through the fast corners of Silverstone but the great downforce, high temperatures and softer rubber worked their tyres terrifically hard and the blistering it caused was costly.\n",
        "    There is no shortage of brain at Mercedes – they have shown that repeatedly with six consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ championships – but this time their much-flexed muscles proved a weakness.\n",
        "    Max Verstappen makes up ground on Lewis Hamilton.\n",
        "    Nor, crucially, did they have any luxury of a lead and cushion over Red Bull on which to fall back. Instead Red Bull and Verstappen had brought the fight to them, right from qualifying onwards. Red Bull’s bold decision to use the hard tyres there, which meant Verstappen started from fourth on the grid and pursued a different strategic direction, paid off. They must be applauded for their willingness to take a chance.\n",
        "    Having done so and moved up to third, behind Bottas and Hamilton, off the start with his rubber proving immediately effective, he hared after the leaders. It became immediately obvious the Red Bull driver meant business.\n",
        "    His intent was clear and it was glorious to behold. So quick was Verstappen that he was advised to ease back to preserve his tyres. The Dutchman, having got within DRS range of Hamilton, was having none of it. “This is the only chance to get close to Mercedes, I am not sitting behind like a grandma,” he replied boisterously.\n",
        "    Red Bull had called the race to perfection. They held Verstappen out a long time, until he had built a 20-second lead after both Mercedes drivers had pitted, and when he came in he emerged right behind Bottas. Once more his bravura commitment was a joy. He immediately attacked on fresher rubber and went – of all places – round the outside of Luffield to retake the lead. The driver had the bit between his teeth and was revelling in his first chance this season to compete with Mercedes.\n",
        "    A second stop was required as Red Bull committed to holding their lead. This time told to push by his team, Verstappen responded joyously: “So we are just going to fully send it” and he promptly did so, hurling his car around with abandon. Several laps later he and Bottas pitted at the same time and they were in a straight fight to the finish. It was one that the Mercedes, tyres blistering at an alarming rate, could simply not win. Indeed after Hamilton had tried in vain to hang on for a one-stop, he pitted and emerged having to chase down Charles Leclerc and then his teammate to clinch second two laps from the end.\n",
        "    For Mercedes a crucial debrief lies ahead. The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted their high downforce and pace came at the cost of working the tyres mercilessly, especially the softer compounds in hot conditions – and next week Barcelona in August beckons.\n",
        "    The world champion was disappointed but F1 has reason to celebrate. Verstappen now has nine career wins but this is his first at Silverstone and his first this season. That it came very much against the odds on a circuit where Mercedes have been completely dominant will have made the success all the sweeter.\n",
        "    After five rounds of a season likely to run to 15 races, Hamilton leads the championship with 107 points, in front of Verstappen on 77 points, with Bottas on 73 in third.\n",
        "    Leclerc was fourth for Ferrari, with Alex Albon in fifth for Red Bull. Lance Stroll and Nico Hülkenberg were in sixth and seventh for Racing Point. Esteban Ocon was eighth for Renault, with Lando Norris in ninth for McLaren and Daniil Kvyat in 10th for AlphaTauri.\n",

Available in over 200 countries and territories, Prime Gaming comes included with an Amazon Prime membership and/or a Prime Video subscription.\n",
        "    Prime Gaming users receive monthly free games and in-game loot (for popular games like “Grand Theft Auto Online,” “Apex Legends,” “Red Dead Redemption 2,” and more) as members. This is similar to how the service was with Twitch Prime. Twitch-specific benefits remain the same too, including the premium chat badge and extra emoticons. Going forward, however, Amazon is dropping Twitch from the program’s name. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n",
        "    “It has nothing negative to do about Twitch,” said Larry Plotnick, director of Prime Gaming. “We love Twitch. We’re still very deeply partnered with them. But the goal here is really to reach as broad of an audience as possible, reach as many gamers as possible.”\n",
        "    Amazon’s first game has a lot to prove. ‘Crucible’ gets a lot right.\n",
        "    Twitch Prime originally launched in 2016, and Plotnick said it had a focus on “predominantly core gamers.” The name change is part of an overall platform-agnostic vision of including different gamers who play on different devices. Quietly, over the last few years, that’s already begun with the inclusion of more mobile games (like in-game content for Yahtzee With Buddies) and other titles across various platforms.\n",
        "    Prime Gaming will soon add more family-friendly titles to its roster, too, including in-game content for “Roblox.” Users will get to keep these PC games permanently, even if they cancel their subscription.\n",
        "    “Today, we have over 50 pieces of content available to customers, 30 pieces of content for in-game and another 20 free games that people can go can download and keep forever,\" Plotnick said. \"And so those are the big changes.”\n",
